# 🧩 Sudoku Java Game

A fully functional **console-based Sudoku game** developed in Java using core OOP concepts and discrete mathematics for my university project.

Created by:

## Features

- ✅ Dynamic Puzzle Generation (random each time)
- 🧠 Multiple Difficulty Levels (Beginner to Hard)
- ↩️ Undo Functionality
- ⚠️ Real-time Error Detection & Validation
- ⌨️ Command-Line UI
- 🧱 Efficient use of Stacks, Queues, and Arrays
- 📉 Clean modular design — easy to understand and expand

---

## Discrete Math Concepts Used

- **Logic & Propositional Statements** – Sudoku rules implemented with quantified logic
- **Set Theory** – Used for validating grid uniqueness
- **Graph Theory** – Sudoku grid treated as a graph (nodes & constraints)
- **Combinatorics** – Random puzzle generation and cell removal
- **Recursion & Backtracking** – Used in puzzle generation (`Generate.java`)

## How to Run

javac -d bin src/*.java

java -cp bin Main

## What I Learned

- How to apply **discrete mathematics concepts** to solve real-world logic problems
- Implementing a complete game using **object-oriented design principles**
- Building and navigating **2D arrays** for grid-based logic
- Using **recursion and backtracking** for dynamic puzzle generation
- Managing game state with **custom stack and queue structures**
- Writing clean, modular code that’s easy to test, extend, and debug
